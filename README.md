## Description

This app was designed to make simple logos for your company or projects.

Custom designed logos can be expensive and unnecessary for most applications. This app cuts out the middle-man and allows you to create a simple SVG logo that will represent your company or project.

By completeing this project I was able to expand on skills I have learned in the coding bootcamp.

I learned that product design can be a very rewarding subject and that backend testing is vital to app deployment.
